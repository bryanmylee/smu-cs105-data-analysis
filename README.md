## Description

Our project aims to identify and explain social factors that significantly influence student academic performance. To achieve this, we start with a dataset of student records capturing information about social factors as well as exam scores, which we refer to as a measure of academic performance. We then use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to find significant trends and correlations between the factors and exam scores, and hone in further on those variables to remove correlated and dependent ones. Finally, we test these factors by building a Na√Øve Bayes classification model and testing the model against sample data.
